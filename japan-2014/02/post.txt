<h2>Tokyo National Museum</h2>
The museum is undoubtedly one of the must-visit destinations in Tokyo. On display is a plethora of Japanese armour, katana, art and artifacts.
<br /><br />
The real attraction however, is the park that surrounds the museum building. In early April it is <em>the best</em> location to view the cherry blossoms.
